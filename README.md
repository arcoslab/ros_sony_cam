## Synopsis

ROS package to use Sony cameras using Sony Remote API.

## Motivation

The Sony camera QX1 provides images with very good quality, so making a ROS node to use this camera(and all the other cameras supported by the Sony Remote API) will be useful for object recognition and face recongnition purposes from a robot.

## Installation

build with catkin
$ catkin_make

then source setup.bash
$ source devel/setup.bash

this last step must be executed from every terminal before using the package

## API Reference

See README in src/sony_cam
